#### Who am I

I am a freelance web developer with 7 years of experience in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I studied computer science at university and then went on to become a software engineer. I built my first website when I was 12. Nowadays I code mostly TypeScript. I also have experience with PHP, C++ and Python.

I am always looking to improve my knowledge and skills. I believe that the only way to become a better developer is by being immersed in the industry and constantly learning new things.

#### My passions

My passions are music, technology and photography. I like listening to music while coding, but when Iâ€™m working on a big project I usually prefer silence so that I can focus better on my work.
